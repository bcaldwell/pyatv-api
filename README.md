# pyatv-api

Very basic api for interacting with the amazing [pyatv](https://github.com/postlund/pyatv) library, with the goal of reducing the overhead of the included atvremote.

Lossy based on [#1-basic-web-server](https://pyatv.dev/documentation/tutorial/#1-basic-web-server), wiht modifications to meet my needs.
